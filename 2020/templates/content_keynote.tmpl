      <h2>From data stream management to distributed dataflows and beyond<br>
        <p>Vasiliki (Vasia) Kalavr &nbsp; <small>Boston University</small></p> </h2>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Recent efforts by academia and open-source communities have established
 stream processing as a principal data analysis technology across industry. All major cloud vendors offer streaming dataflow pipelines and online analytics as managed services. Notable use-cases include real-time fault detection in space networks, city traffic management, dynamic pricing for car-sharing, and anomaly detection in financial transactions. At the same time, streaming dataflow systems are increasingly being used for event-driven applications beyond analytics, such as orchestrating microservices and model serving. In the past decades, streaming technology has evolved significantly, however, emerging applications are once more challenging the design decisions of modern streaming systems. In this talk, I will discuss the evolution of stream processing and bring current trends and open problems to the attention of our community.

        <h2>CockroachDB: Architecture of a Geo-Distributed SQL Database <br>
          <p>Peter Matis &nbsp; <small>Cockroach Labs</small> <br>
          </p>
        </h2>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          In this talk Cockroach Labs' CTO and co-founder, Peter Mattis, will speak to the architecture of an open-source, geo-distributed, SQL database. The talk will be a whirlwind tour of CockroachDBâ€™s architecture, covering the usage of Raft, the challenges of data distribution, distributed transactions, distributed SQL execution, and distributed SQL optimizations.

        <p>
          Peter is the co-founder of Cockroach Labs where he works on a bit of everything, from low level optimization of code to refining the overall design. He has worked on distributed systems for most of his career, designing and implementing the original Gmail backend search and storage system at Google and designing and implementing Colossus, the successor to Google's original distributed file system. In his university days he was one of the original authors of the GIMP and is still amazed when people tell him they use it frequently.

          <h2>A Data Management Perspective on Fairness and Diversity in Learning Systems <br>
          <p>Alexandra Meliou &nbsp; <small>University of Massachusetts, Amherst</small> <br>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Data-driven software has the ability to shape human behavior: it affects the products we view and purchase, the news articles we read, the social interactions we engage in, and, ultimately, the opinions we form. Biases in data and software risk forming, propagating, and perpetuating biases in society. Machine learning research has drawn focus onto this growing problem, but most solutions have focused on addressing the issues at the end of the pipeline: the learning stage. These solutions treat data as an immutable input and try to counteract problems in the learning process. But data is not a black box: we often know its sources, the extraction processes, the integration pipelines, the cleaning methodologies, and other operations that contributed to the data's final form. In this talk, I argue for a comprehensive look over the data evolution pipeline and focus on the role of data management in addressing biases in data-driven decisions. I will present a vision for learning-data management systems and give examples of how data management processes can evolve and provide solutions to biases, highlighting some of my group's recent work on data diversification </p>
