      <h2>Verifying a file system: correctness in presence of crashes <br>
        <p>Frans Kaashoek &nbsp; <small>MIT</small></p> </h2>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          As a case study of system software verification, this talk will describe FSCQ, the first file system with a machine-checkable proof (using the Coq proof assistant) that its implementation meets its specification and whose specification includes crashes. FSCQ provably avoids bugs that have plagued previous file systems, such as performing disk writes without sufficient barriers or forgetting to zero out directory blocks. If a crash happens at an inopportune time, these bugs can lead to data loss. FSCQ's theorems prove that, under any sequence of crashes followed by reboots, FSCQ will recover the file system correctly without losing data. Our experience with FSCQ and results by other researchers suggest that formal verification has much potential, with many interesting and challenging research problems.

        <h2>The Periodic Table of Data Structures <br>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Data structures are everywhere. They define the behavior of modern data systems and data-driven algorithms. For example, with data systems that utilize the correct data structure design for the problem at hand we can reduce the monthly bill of large-scale NoSQL applications on the cloud by hundreds of thousands of dollars. We can accelerate data science tasks by being able to dramatically speed up the computation of statistics over large amounts of data. We can train drastically more neural networks within a given time budget, improving accuracy. However, knowing the right data structure and system design for any given scenario is a notoriously hard problem; there is a massive space of possible designs while there is no single design that is perfect across all data, queries, and hardware scenarios. We will discuss our quest for the first principles of data structures and system design. We will show signs that it is possible to reason about the design space, heading toward a future of self-designing data systems.

          <h2>A Data Management Perspective on Fairness and Diversity in Learning Systems <br>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Data-driven software has the ability to shape human behavior: it affects the products we view and purchase, the news articles we read, the social interactions we engage in, and, ultimately, the opinions we form. Biases in data and software risk forming, propagating, and perpetuating biases in society. Machine learning research has drawn focus onto this growing problem, but most solutions have focused on addressing the issues at the end of the pipeline: the learning stage. These solutions treat data as an immutable input and try to counteract problems in the learning process. But data is not a black box: we often know its sources, the extraction processes, the integration pipelines, the cleaning methodologies, and other operations that contributed to the data's final form. In this talk, I argue for a comprehensive look over the data evolution pipeline and focus on the role of data management in addressing biases in data-driven decisions. I will present a vision for learning-data management systems and give examples of how data management processes can evolve and provide solutions to biases, highlighting some of my group's recent work on data diversification </p>
