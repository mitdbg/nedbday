      <h2>Registration</h2>
      <p>
         This year we will be charging non-students a nominal fee ($50) to defray some of our costs and discourage
         registrants who are not serious about attending (so that we can better plan for food and drink allocation.)
         If this cost is prohibitive to you and you are a non-student, please contact us.

      <h2>Parking and Transportation</h2>
      <p>
         We cannot provide on-campus parking for all attendees. If you are coming from the North or West, you may
         find it most convenient to drive to Alewife Station and take the Red Line to Kendall Square (MIT is about 2
         blocks from the Kendall Square Station, which is on Main St.) If you are coming from the South, you can park
         at Braintree or Quincy Station and take the Red Line as well. See this <a
            href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=RED">Red Line Map</a>. Parking at these
         stations is $7.00.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you are driving to MIT, there are several nearby pay parking lots. See MIT's page listing <a
            href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html">public
         parking facilities</a>. The Cambridge Center lots are all a short walk to the Stata Center. Most lots charge
         $20.00 for one day parking.
