    <h1> Keynote Speakers </h1>
    <p>
      <p>
        We are excited to have two keynote speakers to provide
        perspectives on data management and analysis from the forefront of
        their domains -- parallel query processing and distributed consensus through blockchains!

      <h2>Communication Cost in Parallel Query Evaluation<br>
        <p>Dan Suciu &nbsp; <small>University of Washington</small></p> </h2>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Consider the following question: what is the minimum amount of
          communication required to compute a query in parallel, on a cluster
          with p servers?  If the query is a join of two relations, then a
          standard partitioned hash-join algorithm will exchange the entire
          data.  But if the join attribute is skewed, then we must treat the
          heavy hitters specially, and the communication cost will be larger
          than the entire data.  For multi-join queries, the optimal
          communication cost appears even harder to determine, since it depends
          on the sizes of the intermediate relations, which are hard to
          estimate.  In this talk I will describe a class of algorithms that
          have provably optimal communication cost for multi-join queries.  I
          will start by discussing a simple, one round algorithm that is optimal
          over skew-free data, then discuss how skewed data can be treated
          optimally using additional communication rounds.

He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995, was a principal member of the technical staff at AT&T Labs and joined the University of Washington in 2000. Suciu is conducting research in data management, with an emphasis on topics related to Big Data and data sharing, such as probabilistic data, data pricing, parallel data processing, data security. He is a co-author of two books Data on the Web: from Relations to Semistructured Data and XML, 1999, and Probabilistic Databases, 2011. He is a Fellow of the ACM, holds twelve US patents, received the best paper award in SIGMOD 2000 and ICDT 2013, the ACM PODS Alberto Mendelzon Test of Time Award in 2010 and in 2012, the 10 Year Most Influential Paper Award in ICDE 2013, the VLDB Ten Year Best Paper Award in 2014, and is a recipient of the NSF Career Award and of an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. Suciu serves on the VLDB Board of Trustees, and is an associate editor for the Journal of the ACM, VLDB Journal, ACM TWEB, and Information Systems and is a past associate editor for ACM TODS and ACM TOIS. Suciu's PhD students Gerome Miklau, Christopher Re and Paris Koutris received the ACM SIGMOD Best Dissertation Award in 2006, 2010, and 2016 respectively, and Nilesh Dalvi was a runner up in 2008.

        <h2>My Top Ten Fears about the DBMS Field<br>
          <p>Michael Stonebraker &nbsp; <small>MIT CSAIL</small> <br>
          </p>
        </h2>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          In this paper, I present my top ten fears about the future of the DBMS field, with apologies to David Letterman.  There are three "big fears", which I discuss first.  Five additional fears are a result of the “big three”.  I then conclude with “the big enchilada”, which is a pair of fears.  In each case, I indicate what I think is the best way to deal with the current situation.

          Michael Stonebraker is a computer scientist specializing in database research. Through a series of academic prototypes and commercial startups, Stonebraker's research and products are central to many relational database systems. He is also the founder of many database companies, including Ingres Corporation, Illustra, StreamBase Systems, Vertica and VoltDB, and served as chief technical officer of Informix. He is also an editor for the book Readings in Database Systems.

          Stonebraker's career can be broadly divided into two phases: his time at University of California, Berkeley when he focused on relational database management systems such as Ingres and Postgres, and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he developed more novel data management techniques such as C-Store, H-Store and SciDB . Major prizes include the Turing Award in 2015.
