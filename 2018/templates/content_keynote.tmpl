      <p>
      We are excited to have two keynote speakers to provide
      perspectives on data management and analysis from the forefront of
      their domains -- parallel query processing and distributed consensus through blockchains!

      <h2>Communication Cost in Parallel Query Evaluation<br>
          <p>Dan Suciu &nbsp; <small>University of Washington</small></p> </h2>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the following question: what is the minimum amount of
        communication required to compute a query in parallel, on a cluster
        with p servers?  If the query is a join of two relations, then a
        standard partitioned hash-join algorithm will exchange the entire
        data.  But if the join attribute is skewed, then we must treat the
        heavy hitters specially, and the communication cost will be larger
        than the entire data.  For multi-join queries, the optimal
        communication cost appears even harder to determine, since it depends
        on the sizes of the intermediate relations, which are hard to
        estimate.  In this talk I will describe a class of algorithms that
        have provably optimal communication cost for multi-join queries.  I
        will start by discussing a simple, one round algorithm that is optimal
        over skew-free data, then discuss how skewed data can be treated
        optimally using additional communication rounds.

Dan Suciu is a Professor in Computer Science at the University of Washington. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995, was a principal member of the technical staff at AT&T Labs and joined the University of Washington in 2000. Suciu is conducting research in data management, with an emphasis on topics related to Big Data and data sharing, such as probabilistic data, data pricing, parallel data processing, data security. He is a co-author of two books Data on the Web: from Relations to Semistructured Data and XML, 1999, and Probabilistic Databases, 2011. He is a Fellow of the ACM, holds twelve US patents, received the best paper award in SIGMOD 2000 and ICDT 2013, the ACM PODS Alberto Mendelzon Test of Time Award in 2010 and in 2012, the 10 Year Most Influential Paper Award in ICDE 2013, the VLDB Ten Year Best Paper Award in 2014, and is a recipient of the NSF Career Award and of an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. Suciu serves on the VLDB Board of Trustees, and is an associate editor for the Journal of the ACM, VLDB Journal, ACM TWEB, and Information Systems and is a past associate editor for ACM TODS and ACM TOIS. Suciu's PhD students Gerome Miklau, Christopher Re and Paris Koutris received the ACM SIGMOD Best Dissertation Award in 2006, 2010, and 2016 respectively, and Nilesh Dalvi was a runner up in 2008.

David DeWitt was a faculty member in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1976 to 2008. In March 2008 he retired from UW-Madison and joined Microsoft as a Technical Fellow to start the Jim Gray Systems Laboratory. In the fall of 2016 he left Microsoft to move to Boston to join the MIT faculty. Professor DeWitt is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His pioneering contributions to the field of scalable database systems for “big data” were recognized by ACM with the 2009 Software Systems Award.
