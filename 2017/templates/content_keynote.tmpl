         D. Richard Hipp
         <small>Primary author of SQLite</small>
      </h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
      SQLite is the mostly widely deployed and used database engine in the world. But it is also, perhaps, the most widely misunderstood. Unlike most other database engines that are designed to run in the datacenter, SQLite is an embedded database engine designed for use on devices at the edge of the network. Consequently, SQLite embodies several non-traditional and sometimes controversial design choices. This talk will overview the history of SQLite and describe its unusual use-case. The talk will also summarize the design and implementation of SQLite, with emphasis on those aspects of SQLite that differ from common practice and on lessons learned from supporting SQLite for over 15 years.

      <h2>Le Cong <small>CRISPR founder</small></h2>
 
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
      Advances in genome sequencing and related technology have led to unprecedented pace at which we can identify genomic and epigenomic changes associated with human health and disease. Nonetheless, due to the vast number of variants under investigation, validating their biological functions and exploring them as potential drug targets remain extremely time and cost consuming. The ability to quickly and accurately assess these candidate variants is essential to the goal of precision medicine. For this purpose, genome editing tools adapted from CRISPR-Cas system can be employed for modifying DNA sequences at genome scale with minimal expenses. I discuss here how genome engineering technology can be deployed as versatile discovery tool. I will focus on the power and precision of novel technology development and describing its potential therapeutic application. In addition, I will highlight the emerging trend on how computational analysis could be integrated with new generation of molecular tools to transform our ability to connect genotype with phenotype for treating human diseases.

      <p>
      Dr. Le Cong obtained his B.S. with highest honor from Tsinghua University, his Ph.D. from Harvard University, and is currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He completed thesis work mainly in Dr. Feng Zhang’s lab, where he did pioneering studies on genetic and epigenetic engineering, focusing on developing technologies based on TALE and CRISPR-Cas systems and adapting them for gene therapy applications. His work was the first to demonstrate CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in eukaryotic cells (Cong et al. Science. 2013), and is co-inventor of multiple patents on related technologies. He is now working on single-cell genomics and systems biology in Dr. Aviv Regev's group. He has published in many high-impact journals including Science, Nature, Cell, Nature Biotechnology, and written for Springer’s Book Series Neuromethods and Methods in Molecular Biology. He is recipient of multiple awards and fellowships including the HHMI International Student Research Fellowship, the CRI Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowships Award, among others.
