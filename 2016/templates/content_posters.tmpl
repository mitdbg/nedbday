      North East Database Day Posters
   </h1>
   <p>The poster session will include drinks and appetizers. It will be held in Building 32, R&D Commons, 4th Floor, Gates Tower. Take either set of elevators to the 4th floor.</p>
   <h3>Information for Poster Presenters</h3>
   <p>We will be able to provide poster board, easels, and mounting supplies for you.
      You will need to print your poster and bring it with you to the conference. We recommend posters to be either A0, A1, or ANSI D or E sizes  (either 24" by 32" or 36" by 42"). 
      Our poster boards are large enough to accommodate any of these. You may orient your poster as you see fit. If you prefer to print out individual 8.5" x 11" pages, our board will be large enough to 
      accommodate about 12 pages. However, we recommend making a single poster -- if you don't have access to a large format printer Fedex/Kinkos can print your poster for you.
   </p>
   <p>We will have a storage area for poster tubes at the conference. You will be able to set up your posters during the lunch break.</p>

              <strong>Harnessing the Power of Big Data:Using a Spatial Temporal Data Model to answer Big Questions for economic prosperity</strong><br/>

              <div id="po1A" class="abstract" style="display: none;">
                <p><i>Big data is the key to answer questions facing the society: economic, social, political, financial and educational. Despite its indisputable power or potential and its Omni presence, big data continues to be a challenge because of its complexity, diversity, disperse nature and most of all because of the difficulty in creating the appropriate tools to collect, integrate, clean and analyze it. In our approach, we are creating a spatial temporal data model to automatically integrate and transform data contained in spreadsheets collected from heterogeneous public data sources. We introduce the Data Integration through Object Modelling  (DIOM) framework which successfully overcomes some of the well-known challenges related to leveraging data from diverse sources, like diversity in schema formats and extracting processes.First we generalize and template the data from the spreadsheets and represent it into a unified data model. Secondly we automatically extract and transform the data from the spreadsheets, while profiling the meta data in the process. Lastly we provide users with the opportunity to interactively perform repairs before loading the data in the database.The experimental results confirm the merit of our approach and mark a huge step in enabling individuals and organizations and advocate for decisions for economic prosperity. The reduction in the cost of collecting processing and reporting data is tremendous.</i></p>
